# Django For Beginners - 3.0
### By: William S. Vincent

This include code for each chapter.
- Each chapter and its previous chapters exists on branch `chapter-<chapter_number>`.
- To run a project, cd into that Chapter.
  - If the requirement file is not present then it means all you need is `django`.
  - Otherwise spin up a Python 3 environment:
    ```shell
    $ pip install requirements.txt
    $ python manage.py runserver
    ```
